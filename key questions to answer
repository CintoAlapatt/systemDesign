– What caching strategy would you use?
– How would you handle sudden traffic spikes?
– How do you diagnose performance bottlenecks?

• Explain Python’s GIL. How would you optimize a CPU-bound task?

• Explain event-driven architecture. When would you use an event bus vs direct service calls?

• Explain how you would secure an API that serves millions of requests per day.

• What’s the difference between a service mesh and an API gateway?

• How do you prevent cascading failures in a distributed system?

• What are the key trade-offs between AWS Lambda, ECS, and EC2 for running backend workloads?

• How do you debug and optimize long-running SQL queries at the database level?

• How do you optimize rendering performance for a large React application?

• What are the efficient ways to render large lists in React?

• How do you handle data fetching efficiently in a React application?

• Explain hydration in React, and how to handle common hydration errors?

• How do you build efficient CI/CD pipelines for fast and reliable deployments?

• How do you integrate AI-powered autocompletion into your development environment?

• What are the risks of using LLMs in production systems?

• How do you fine-tune an AI model on proprietary company data while maintaining privacy?

• What are retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, and how do they improve LLM reliability?

• How do you convince leadership to adopt a technical migration (e.g., monolith to microservices)?

• When is it appropriate to rewrite a system from scratch vs iteratively refactor?

• How do you handle a high-severity incident in production?
